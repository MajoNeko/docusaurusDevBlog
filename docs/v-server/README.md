In this walkthrough you will learn how to setup SSH keys on a virtual server, disable password authentication in favour of using SSH authentication, installing and configuring a web server and setting up a Git account with username, email and SSH key on your server.

## Setup and copy SSH keys

### Step 1 - Generate an SSH key pair 
In the terminal type the following: 
```bash
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -f C:/Users/user-directory/.ssh/id_ed25519_VServer -C "key name comment"
```
> [!Note]
> -t ed25519 : This will generate a new SSH key pair using Ed25519 key type (recommended as it is faster, shorter and has better security properties).

> -f ~/.ssh/id_ed25519_VServer : Specifies where the key pair should be generated (filename, usefull for organization purposes and for multiple key pairs)

> -C "key name comment" : provides a comment for the key pair

### Step 2 : Verify your SSH key pairs 
You can view your key pairs using the foloowing command:
```bash
    ls ~/.ssh
```
> [!Note]
> ~ represents your home directory

### Step 3 - Test your server connection
Connect to the server using the following command:
 ```bash
    ssh user@ip-address   
```

If you are able to connect to the server then you can log off and move on to the next step.
```bash
    logout
```

### Step 4 - Copying your SSH key
Copy your SSH public key to the authorized_key file using the following command:
```bash
    ssh-copy-id -i C:/Users/user-directory/.ssh/id_ed25519_VServer.pub user@ip-address
```
> [!Note]
> -i stands for identity

### Step 6 - Test your connection using the SSH key:
```bash
    ssh -i C:/Users/user-directory/.ssh/id_ed25519_VServer user@ip-address
```

## Disable Password logins

### Step 1 - Open the config file
Open the config file for editing using the following command:
```bash
    sudo nano etc/ssh/sshd_config
```

### Step 2 - Changing Password authentication configuration
Find and edit the line:
```bash 
    "#PasswordAuthentication yes" 
```
change it to
```bash
    "PasswordAuthentication no"
```
Save ('Ctrl + O') and exit ('Ctrl + X') the file

### Step 3 - Restart the service
Restarting the sshd service to reload the config changes.
To restart the service use the command:
```bash
    sudo systemctl restart ssh.service
```

### Step 4 - Test the Configuration
Logout and attempt to login with user name and password. If all went well you should receive a Permission denied (publickey) messgae which tells you that you need to use your public key to login.
You can now securely login using your SSH key as demonstrated in

## Setup Nginx

### Step 1 - Update the system
Update the server to prepare for the webserver installation:
```bash
        sudo apt update
```

### Step 2 - Install Nginx
Install the Nginx webserver using the following command:
```bash
sudo apt install nginx -y
```
> [!Note]
> -y (yes) confirms the installation


### Step 3 - Verify Nginx status
To check if Nginx is running use the following command:
```bash
systemctl status nginx.service
```
If you enter your Virtual Servers IP address in the browser you should now see the default Nginx HTML starting page

### Step 4 - Create an alternative starting page
Create a new directory for the alternative HTML page
```bash
    sudo mkdir /var/www/alternatives
```
Create the HTML file:
```bash
    sudo touch /var/www/alternatives/alternate-index.html
```
Edit the HTML file:
```bash
    sudo nano /var/www/alternatives/alternate-index.html
```

### Step 5 - Configure Nginx
We now need to create a configuration file for the alternative page
```bash
    sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/alternatives  
```
Sample configuration:
```bash
    server {
        listen 8081;
        listen [::]:8081;
        root /var/www/alternatives;
        index alternate-index.html;

        location / {
            try_files $uri $uri/ =404;
        }
    }  
```
> [!Note]
>  try_files $uri $uri/ =404; if a page name is not found within the given structure a 404 page not found page will be displayed instead

### Step 6 - Restart Nginx
After completing any changes to the config or HTML files, you must restart the Nginx server for the changes to take effect
```bash
    sudo service nginx restart
```
> [!Note]
>  after restarting you can check the status of the service using the command from step 3:
> ```bash
>       systemctl status nginx.service
> ```

### Step 7 - Test the changes
You can now see the new alternative HTML start page by entering the IP address with the port defined inthe config file:
```bash
    http://ip-address:8081/
```
