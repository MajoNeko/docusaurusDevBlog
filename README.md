This website is built using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator.

## Repository Description

This repository hosts a developer blog built with Docusaurus. It includes tools and scripts for creating, managing, and deploying static web content. The software supports rapid local development, customizable theming, and seamless deployment to platforms like GitHub Pages or NGINX.
This section will be personalised and updated with more information as more projects are completed

## Quickstart

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v24 or later recommended)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) (only required if [deploying using NGINX](#deploying-using-nginx))

1. Installation

   ```
   $ npm install
   ```

2. Local Development

   ```
   $ npm start
   ```

   This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

3. Build

   ```
   $ npm run build
   ```

   This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.

4. Deployment

   In order to deploy onto Github Pages, ensure that your `docusaurus.config.ts` conforms with the [documentation guidelines](https://docusaurus.io/docs/deployment#deploying-to-github-pages). 

For detailed information about deploying this Docusaurus project, refer to the [Deployment](#deployment) section below.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- `blog/`: Contains markdown files for blog posts. Blog-related metadata is automatically picked up by the Docusaurus configuration.
- `docs/`: Contains markdown files for documentation. These files are referenced in `sidebars.ts` to define the sidebar structure.
- `src/`: Contains custom React components, CSS, and JavaScript for additional functionality or theming.
- `static/`: Stores static assets (e.g., images, icons) served directly without processing.
- `sidebars.ts`: Configures the structure of sidebars in the documentation section.
- `docusaurus.config.ts`: Main configuration file for customizing and managing Docusaurus behavior.
- `build/`: Generated after running the `npm run build` command. Contains the static website files ready for deployment.

New content can be added as follows:

- Add new documentation files to the `docs/` folder.
- Add new blog posts to the `blog/` folder. No additional configuration is required.

## Deployment

This website is automatically deployed to Github Pages using a pre-configured Github Actions Workflow. The setup can be found within the repositories settings under the "code,planning, and automation" section.
Github Actions is a CI/CD platform that allows you to automate the build, test and deployment pipeline. When a change is commited to the repository, the changes are automatically deployed.
